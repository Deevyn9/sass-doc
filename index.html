                <div class="info">Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.</div>

            <div class="syntax-info">
                <p>
                    Sass supports two different syntaxes. Each one can load the other, so it's up to you and your team which one to choose.
                </p>
                <div class="types">
                    <div class="scss">
                        <h3>SCSS</h3>
                        <p>The SCSS syntax uses the file extension .scss. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="indented">
                        <h3>The Indented Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, and so it uses the file extension .sass. Because of this extension, it’s sometimes just called “Sass”. The indented syntax supports all the same features as SCSS, but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.
                        In general, any time you’d write curly braces in CSS or SCSS, you can just indent one level deeper in the indented syntax. And any time a line ends, that counts as a semicolon. There are also a few additional differences in the indented syntax that are noted throughout the reference.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="rules" class="section rules">
            <div class="rules-header"><h1>Style Rules</h1></div>
            <div class="rules-info">
                <p>Style rules are the foundation of Sass, just like they are for CSS. And they work the same way: you choose which elements to style with a selector, and declare properties that affect how those elements look.</p>
            <div class="nesting">
                <h3>Nesting</h3>
                <p>But Sass wants to make your life easier. Rather than repeating the same selectors over and over again, you can write one style rules inside another. Sass will automatically combine the outer rule’s selector with the inner rule’s.</p>
                <div class="nesting-selectors">
                    <div class="selector-list">
                        <h4>Selector Lists</h4>
                        <p>Nested rules are clever about handling selector lists (that is, comma-separated selectors). Each complex selector (the ones between the commas) is nested separately, and then they’re combined back into a selector list.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="selector-comb">
                        <h4>Selector Combinators</h4>
                        <p>You can nest selectors that use combinators as well. You can put the combinator at the end of the outer selector, at the beginning of the inner selector, or even all on its own in between the two.</p>
                    </div>               
                </div>
                <div class="advanced-nesting">
                    <h4>Advanced Nesting</h4>
                    <p>If you want to do more with your nested style rules than just combine them in order with the descendant combinator (that is, a plain space) separating them, Sass has your back</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="interpolation">
                <h3>Interpolation</h3>
                <p>You can use interpolation to inject values from expressions like variables and function calls into your selectors. This is particularly useful when you’re writing mixins, since it allows you to create selectors from parameters your users pass in.</p>

        <section id="ops" class="section ops">
            <div class="ops-header"><h2>Operators</h2></div>
            <div class="ops-info"><p>Sass supports a handful of useful operators for working with different values. These include the standard mathematical operators like + and *, as well as operators for various other types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>== and != are used to check if two values are the same.</li>
                    <li>+, -, *, /, and % have their usual mathematical meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches the use of units in scientific math.</li>
                    <li><, <=, >, and >= check whether two numbers are greater or less than one another.</li>
                    <li>and, or, and not have the usual boolean behavior. Sass considers every value “true” except for false and null.</li>
                    <li>+, -, and / can be used to concatenate strings.</li>
                </ul></div>
